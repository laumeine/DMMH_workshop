We simulated data based on data from the HMZ STRESS Study (Laura Meine) using the "modgo" R package (Koliopanos et al., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2048-7692)


In the HMZ STRESS Study, Swiss medical students completed a video-recorded interview in which they reported on neutral, happy, and stressful memories.

The file "simulated_video_feature_set.csv" contains features extracted from video files using OpenWillis "emotional expressivity v2.1" function.
